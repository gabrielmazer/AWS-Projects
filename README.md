# AWS Projects

This repository is a collection of various AWS-related projects that I’ve completed as part of my cloud computing learning journey. Each project explores different AWS services, with the goal of becoming proficient in cloud architecture and infrastructure management.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized into subfolders for easy navigation and understanding. Every project folder contains:

- **docs/**: Documentation files related to the project.
- **Images/**: Visualizations or screenshots of the project outputs.
- **Project Files/**: The source code, configuration files, or any other files required for the project.
- **README.md**: Detailed explanation of the project, its goals, services used, and insights gained.

## Purpose

The main focus of this repository is to deepen my knowledge of **cloud computing**, particularly using AWS services such as QuickSight, S3, EC2, Lambda, and more. As I progress through my learning journey, I will be adding new projects to this repository, expanding my understanding of AWS and cloud infrastructure.

## Completed Projects

### 1. [Netflix Data Analysis Using AWS QuickSight](https://github.com/gabrielmazer/aws-projects/tree/main/1.%20Visualize%20data%20with%20Quicksight)
This project uses Amazon QuickSight to analyze and visualize Netflix data stored in an S3 bucket. The analysis focuses on content distribution (movies and TV shows) by release year and genre, providing insights into Netflix’s content trends.

#### Key Insights:
- Significant increase in movie releases post-2015 compared to TV shows.
- Trends in certain genres show consistent growth over the years.

### 2. [Banking Chatbot Using Amazon Lex, Lambda, and CloudFormation](https://github.com/gabrielmazer/AWS-Projects/tree/main/2.%20Chatbot%20with%20Amazon%20Lex)
This project involves creating a banking chatbot using Amazon Lex for natural language processing, AWS Lambda to handle backend logic, and CloudFormation to automate deployment. The chatbot helps users check their account balances, transfer funds between accounts, and confirm actions through conversational prompts. It also uses context tags for session management and leverages Lambda for dynamic balance responses.

#### Key Insights:
- Integrated Amazon Lex for chatbot interaction, AWS Lambda for backend logic, and CloudFormation for automation.
- Implemented dynamic slot values and context tags for session management, improving conversational flow.
- IAdded confirmation prompts for secure fund transfers between accounts.
- Utilized CloudFormation for quick bot re-deployment.
- Fixed permissions issue between Amazon Lex and Lambda, enhancing the bot's functionality after troubleshooting.

## Learning Goals

My ultimate goal is to gain expertise in cloud computing, with a focus on:
- Designing scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions.
- Automating deployments and infrastructure management using AWS services.
- Improving data analytics and visualization using tools like QuickSight.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore AWS and build more projects!
